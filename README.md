# Crime Analysis USA

Predictive modeling and exploratory analysis project focused on crime in the United States. The main goal is to explore the relationships between socio-economic variables and different types of offenses, and to build predictive models based on these data.

## Dataset

The repository includes:

- `CommViolPredUnnormalizedData.txt`  
  Dataset with variables related to criminal activity and socio-economic characteristics. It is used as the basis for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Analysis reports

Two main files are provided:

- `Crime_Analysis.qmd`  
  Quarto source document containing all the code, figures, and narrative for the analysis and modeling.

- `Crime_Analysis.html`  
  HTML report rendered from the `.qmd` file. Due to its size, GitHub cannot display it directly in the browser. To view it, you need to **download the file and open it locally** in a web browser.

## Analysis contents

The report includes, among others:

- Data cleaning and preparation of the crime dataset.  
- Exploratory data analysis of crime variables and socio-economic context.  
- Construction of predictive models (e.g., regression/classification) to estimate crime levels.  
- Model evaluation using appropriate metrics and discussion of the results.
